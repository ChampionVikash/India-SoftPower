                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> <span style="font-weight:bold;">🌞Cultural institutes</span> - Germany has the Goethe Institut, China has its Confucius institutes, and France has the Alliance Francaise. India needs to invest more in its equivalent cultural institute, the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR), or create a newer, more youth-oriented institute.<br>
                  <span style="font-weight:bold;"> 🌞Museums </span>- India most certainly needs a world-class museum on par with the great museums of the world.<br>
                  <span style="font-weight:bold;">🌞Sports </span>- India should invest more in sports, and not only for the sake of winning more medals at the Olympics.<br> 
                  <span style="font-weight:bold;">🌞Tourism</span>- India should do a better job at crafting an image of itself and its history that goes beyond just the Taj Mahal and a few Rajput forts.<br> 
                  <span style="font-weight:bold;">🌞Cinema</span> - India makes more movies a year than any other country and Bollywood films are popular throughout the Middle East and Central Asia. Yet, India has done little to convert this love of its movies (and songs) into a desire for people to go to India or learn more about it.
